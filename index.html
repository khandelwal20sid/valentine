      <p>Dear Muskan,</p>
      <p>
        We both know how things are between us and I also know that you're a bit
        doubtful about me coz me harkat patak deta kuch kuch. Last 1-1.5 years
        me itna toh I know ki we both are a bit different in terms of our
        thought process, kya cheej acchi lagti kya nhi lagti, similarity bhi hai
        esa nhi ki pure hi diff hai, par haan difference hai cheejo me and
        shayad isliye kabhi kabhi saamne wale ki cheej ka ulta impact ho jata
        humpe. Tbh mujhe bhi laga hai kaafi baar ki ise itna samajh nhi aara yr
        kya samjhegi ye jo me sochra and I know tujhe bhi laga hai esa. But then
        I think of all the memories we made, initial days, my first proposal,
        our first date, the trip, movie nights and many more, how happy we were
        together...
      </p>
      <p>
        Although then cheeje bigdi and here we are, sath hai bhi aur nhi bhi.
        Idk like I don't want to over burden you, I know you need time for
        yourself to make sure things and I understand that, shayad isliye I've
        been around since last 6 months. I'm happy ki we're still sort of
        together par tbh there's always that gap, that hole jo chubhta rehta.
        I'm sorry for things I did, I'm sorry for hurting you but you mean soo
        much to me, my love for you hasn't faded a bit and I really miss the old
        us. I'm not looking to rush back without making sure it's what you want
        as well. I just know ki I want to explore the possibilities of us again
        together jaha I'm or even you're not worrying about the uncertainty of
        our relationship, jaha we stay in a healthy relationship and not fraught
        with disagreements causing unnecessary breaks. And thus I want to ask
        you that...
